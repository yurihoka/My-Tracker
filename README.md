# MyTrack Project

MyTrack is a single page application that can track all your accounts and transactions.

User should be able to create multiple accounts, set transactions like deposits, withdraws and transfer between accounts.

All the data should be entered manually, but since it's posted, records will be kept in the server.

> This project has educational purpose only. Real personal data should not be entered for the sake of privacy.

With all that said, let's code! ðŸ’» ðŸš€

## Screenshot

This design is just a reference, it doesn't mean that your project should looks like the same.

## Setup for Backend

1. change directory to `/backend`

```zsh
  cd backend
```

2. install dependencies

```zsh
  npm i
```

3. run express server

```zsh
  npm run dev
```

> For this project, you are not required to work on backend, but please feel free to browse (You can update if you would like to ðŸ˜Ž). Please ask for help if anything goes wrong or if the server is not working as expected.

### How to split the project (in case of team mates)

> This is just a recommendation!

- Member 1 (Hard):
  - New Transaction section
- Member 2 (Moderate):
  - New Account section
  - Account Summary
- Member 3 (Easy):
  - Transactions list
  - Filter by account, category, transaction type (bonus)
- Bonus:
  - Notification animation when a new transaction or account is created

## Please keep in mind!!

- if something fails in your team, it is not one of your team member's failure but `WHOLE TEAM`.
- if you do not want to lead, `follow` the lead
- Decide as a team
- Be responsive - no longer than half day
- Please flag if you think you are behind
- If you stuck on a problem more than 1 hour, It is time to ask for help
- Take an action instead of keep thinking
